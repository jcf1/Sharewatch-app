# Sharewatch: Communal Stopwatch
Source Code for "Sharewatch: Communal Stopwatch" app currently available on the Apple App Store.

Sharewatch allows a user to start multiple stopwatches for multiple users at the same time and have them all synced up. One user can create a room that others can join using the generated room code; the first user is then able to start all the connected watches at the touch of a button.
